# TODO:
- Add node-opus to package.json
- Install ffmpeg
- Set up a server.
- Test functionality.

# Potential Upcoming Features:
- Maybe set up an esports live updater (That's a lot of work)

# Commands
- `ping` bot will return pong in the same channel.
- `-play 'youtubelink'` Will queue video and play if the queue is empty.
    - Ensure that the `youtubelink` looks something like:  https://youtube.com/watch?v=x where 'x' is the video code.
